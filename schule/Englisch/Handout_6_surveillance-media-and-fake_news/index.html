                    <ul>
                        <li>Surveillance is the monitoring of behavior, activities or information for the purpose of influencing, managing or directing.</li>
                        <li>It can be used by the government (as prevention of crime, protection, investigating a crime, …)</li>
                        <li>It can be used by criminal organizations (to plan and commit a crime)</li>
                        <li>Surveillance can be viewed as violation of privacy. Liberal democracies often have laws against surveillance,<br>
                            authoritarian governments don't have any laws that restrict surveillance.</li>
                        <li>Most of surveillance comes from laptops and mobile phones.</li>
