                <h2>noOS Soccer Team</h2>
                <p>
                    The noOS soccer team was founded in 2016 by Marc Spieler.<br>
                    With a robot based on three qfix controllerboards they took part in the Soccer 1 vs. 1 Open league.<br>
                    The first team member was Silas Birk. He stayed only for one year and was replaced by Tobias Bungard.<br>
                    In the second year the team moved on to the Soccer 2 vs. 2 Open league.<br>
                    They developed two new robots entirely from scratch. While Tobias Bungard took care of the ball recognition using a Raspberry Pi, Marc Spieler took over tasks such as alectronics and frimware development.<br>
                    At the age of 19, now too old for participating in the RoboCup Junior competition, Tobias had to say goodbye and was replaced by Frieder Lontzek.<br>
                    In 2019 and 2020 Frieder is responsible for the ball and goal recognition using a Raspberry Pi and designs models for 3D printing.<br>
                    <br>
                    Below you can see the robots and team in action at the RoboCup Junior European Championship 2019.

                    This Website actually was a long term Project of mine.<br>
                    I've worked on it for roughly half a year between my soccer team and my final year of school.<br>
                    It's completely self-programmed in HTML and CSS and with me being a pretty perfectionistic person it took countless iterations to get this page up and running.
